# MySQLChat
This is a web program that features a MySQL login and chat using three databases.
This project is a proof of concept for me to be able to make a cascading PHP website.
The project includes no secutriy for SQL Injections or attacks at your cookies. 
The chat has to be updated through refreshing the page, although I could easily make a script so it will auto refresh.
There are a few other minor issues with the friends which I will be trying to solve.
