# MySQLChat
This is a web program that features a MySQL login and chat using three tables.<br/>
This project is a proof of concept for me to be able to make a cascading PHP website.<br/>
The project includes no secutriy for SQL Injections or attacks at your cookies. <br/>
The chat has to be updated through refreshing the page, although I could easily make a script so it will auto refresh.<br/>
There are a few other minor issues with the friends which I will be trying to solve.<br/>
